# Hi, I'm Andria 🧙‍♀️

I'm a full-stack web developer with a passion 🔥 for front-end development and an aspiring Rust developer. I enjoy working on open source projects. I also like exploring automation 🤖 and tooling 🔧. Most of the time, I like to relax by playing some video games and watching TV shows. Unionize your workplace! And never stop striving for the day when Capitalism falls.

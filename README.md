# Hi, I'm Andria 🧙‍♀️

I'm a web developer with a passion 🔥 for front-end development and I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional. I enjoy working on open source projects; I'm currently maintaining React Spring Modal and contributing to Use Shopping Cart. I also like exploring automation 🤖 and tooling 🔧. Most of the time, I like to relax by playing some casual video games and watching TV shows. My pronouns are she/her/hers.
